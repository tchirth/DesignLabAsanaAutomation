This script is intended as a quick fix to an issue we had recently (May 2021) where without our input, a webhook with Asana desynced and was automatically deleted.

When this occurs, simply edit the file to create the intended webhook and record all information to update the webhook database. 

**Remember to remove the deleted webhook from the database.**
